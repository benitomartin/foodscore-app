# **THE WEBSITE** :clapper:

This repository is the Website of the [Data Science Project](https://github.com/benitomartin/foodscore-code) developed for food recognition using deep learning.  

You can have a look at the Website, but unfortunatelly the prediction can only be done once you train the model and get your own weights.

Thererfore, it is recommended to read first that repository in order to understand how the model works and how you can clone the repository.

## :thinking: **How to use the Website** 

The [Website](https://foodscore.streamlit.app/) is very easy to use. First, you need to upload an image that contains at least one food category of the Food100 dataset.

Then you can move the white square on the left image to select the food item. You can see the cropped image in the right side. 
Once you have selected the food item, click on the `show nutritions` to get the prediction and the nutrients.
